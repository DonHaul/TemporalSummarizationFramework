INESC TEC Temporal Summarization Framework License Agreement

Copyright (C) 2019, INESC TEC

INESC TEC Temporal Summarization Framework is a collection-independent automatic temporal summarization framework: a novel feature-based system for multi-lingual temporal summarization framework, which supports texts of different sizes, domain or languages. INESC TEC Temporal Summarization Framework does not rely on dictionaries nor thesauri, neither is trained against any corpora. Instead, we follow an unsupervised approach which builds upon features extracted from the text and change-point detection methods to find relevant documents and dates to provide a timeline of documents.
